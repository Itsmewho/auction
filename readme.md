#

Do an additional 2 or 3 of these kind of projects,..

- Choose from:

  Intermediate:

  - Blackjack.
  - Pong.

#

Maybe add to next projects boilerplate:

- Add data change for user account[role=user]
- Add reset password via mail/phone?
- Look into 2FA.
- Look into last login from {"date": "UTC", "location": location, "earth":{"long":"longditude, "lat":latitude"}}
  - If not recognized.
    - Give secoundairy password and email/sms confimation.
      - Lock location (yes/no)
- Check login credentials and MAC-addres??. If no match: send accept message to,.
  - If already used combination: Skip.
  - Try to look into the possibilty for harddrive, motherboard serial combination???
- Lock out Admin account if wrong input or MAC-addres(send email/sms to,.)
- Lock out User account if wrong input \*3 (send email/sms)

- Use different DB for ADMIN
- Use different DB for Admin Login Combinations.
- Use different DB for User Login combinations.

#

    If comfortable with CRUD-operations.
    Start working with more with API's and data collection.

#

- Don't resort to learning: GUI's
  - GUI's are not part off the 'goal', as it seems for now!
  - Keep the terminal interface.
